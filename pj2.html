  <h2>Fixed Assets Online</h2>
<p class="item-intro text-muted">I was the lead UX designer and the information architect for this online CPA application. This product aims to provides solutions for business owners to track the varied lifecycles of the assets and get the tax refund. No IT infrastructure needed other than a computer connected to the Internet. Anytime, anywhere access to the data. And no need to worry about upgrades and backups.</p>
